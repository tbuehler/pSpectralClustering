# p-Spectral Clustering

This archive contains a Matlab implementation of *p-Laplacian based 
spectral clustering*. Given a graph with weight matrix W, a bipartition 
is computed using the second eigenvector of the unnormalized or 
normalized graph p-Laplacian. A multipartitioning is then obtained using 
a recursive splitting scheme.



## Installation

To install p-Spectral Clustering, compile the mexfiles 
by starting the make.m script from within Matlab. The clustering can 
then be computed using the function 'pSpectralClustering'. 



### Usage

    [clusters,cuts,cheegers] = pSpectralClustering(W,p,normalized,k)

### Input variables

    W             Sparse weight matrix. Has to be symmetric.
    p             Has to be in the interval ]1,2]. Controls the trade-off 
                  between a relaxation of Rcut/Ncut (p=2) and RCC/NCC (p->1)
    normalized    true for Ncut/NCC, false for Rcut/RCC
    k             number of clusters

### Output variables

    clusters      mx(k-1) matrix containing in each column the computed 
                  clustering for each partitioning step.
    cuts          (k-1)x1 vector containing the Ratio/Normalized Cut values 
                  after each partitioning step.
    cheegers      (k-1)x1 vector containing the Ratio/Normalized Cheeger 
                  Cut values after each partitioning step.
