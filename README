P-SPECTRAL CLUSTERING

This archive contains a Matlab implementation of 
p-Laplacian based spectral clustering as proposed in the paper

Thomas Buehler and Matthias Hein,
Spectral Clustering based on the graph p-Laplacian,
In Leon Bottou and Michael Littman, Proceedings of the 26th 
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 
81-88, Omnipress, 2009

Current version: V1.1



INSTALLATION

To install p-Spectral Clustering, compile the mexfiles 
by starting the make.m script from within Matlab. The eigenvector 
and resulting clustering can then be computed using the functions 
'computePEigenvector' and 'pSpectralClustering', respectively. 



SHORT DOCUMENTATION

For more information type 'help functionname' on the Matlab prompt.


pSpectralClustering (main method): Computes a multipartitioning using 
the recursive splitting scheme described in the paper. Performs 
p-Spectral Clustering into k clusters of the graph with weight matrix 
W by using the second eigenvector of the unnormalized/normalized 
graph p-Laplacian.

computePEigenvector: Computes the second p-eigenvector of the graph 
p-Laplacian of the graph with weight matrix W using the iterative 
scheme introduced in the paper. As described in the paper, the 
iterative scheme is initialized with the second eigenvector of the 
standard graph Laplacian (p=2). However one can also provide an 
initialization with a different p-eigenvector.

createClusters: Transforms an eigenvector into a cluster indicator 
function. You have the possibility to choose between different 
thresholding criteria.
